# The nature of code

Various examples, experiments and utils that I've made as part of reading [The Nature of Code](http://natureofcode.com/). 

Originally started [working on this on CodePen](https://codepen.io/collection/XEPGLp/).

## Submodules

When cloning, remember to use `git clone  --recurse-submodules https://github.com/laustdeleuran/nature-of-code.git` to clone submodules as well ([`koalition-utils`](https://bitbucket.org/koalition/koalition-utils/src/master/)). 

## Deployment

Run `npm run deploy` to deploy this project to Github Pages. Remember to make sure that submodules and dependencies are installed and that `./deploy.sh` is executable.
